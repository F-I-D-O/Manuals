# Debugging
There is a debugger included in PostgreSQL. However its support in IDEs is limited: 

- DataGrip: No built-in support.
    - there is a [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18419-postgresql-debugger) but it is outdated.
- pgAdmin: There is a [debugger](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/debugger.html).
