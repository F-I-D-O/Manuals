# DataGrip

## Import Formats
DataGrip can handle imports only from separator baset files (csv, tsv).

## View Geometry
In the reuslt window/tab, click on the gear wheel -> `Show GeoView`. However, the **geoviewer has a fixed WGS84 projection, so you have to project the result to this projection first**.

##  Create a spatial Index
There is currently no GUI tool for that in DataGrip. Just add a normal index and modify the auto generated statement by changing `<column>` to `USING GIST(<column>)` at the end of the statement.


## Filter out store procedures

1. right-click on `routines`
1. click `open table`
1. sort by type


## Creating functions and procedures
There is no UI available currently, use Navicat or console


## Duplicate table
Drag the table in the database explorer and drop it to the location you want it to copy to.

## Known issues and workarounds

## Cannot delete a database due to DataGrip's own connections
Before deleting a database we need to close all DataGrip sessions connected to the database. We can do that in the sessions window.

### DataGrip displays objects that were deleted
Sometimes, DataGrip displays objects that were deleted. Additionally, it it displays errors when trying to refresh the view. Solution:

1. right-click on database connection (root object in the database explorer)
1. click on `Diagnostics` -> `Force refresh`



# Navicat
## Cannot connect to db
Symptoms:

- cant connect to db server: `Could not connect`
- after editing the connection and trying to save it (ok button): `connection is being used`

Try:

1. close navicat
2. open navicat, edit connection
1. click test connection
1. click ok, and start the connection by double click



# PgAdmin
The best way to install the PgAdmin is to use the [EDB PostgreSQL installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) and uncheck the database installation during the installation configuration. This way, we also install useful tools like `psql`

## Diagrams
To create diagram from an existing database: right click on the database -> `Generate ERD`
