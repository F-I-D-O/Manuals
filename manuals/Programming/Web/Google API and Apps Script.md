## Anchored Comments
According to my experiments and [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23498275/creating-anchored-comments-programmatically-in-google-docs). It is not possible to add achore comments to google docs.

Also, it is not possible to get any readable anchors from existing comments. The only way to extract comments with anchors is to export the document as Microsoft Word.
