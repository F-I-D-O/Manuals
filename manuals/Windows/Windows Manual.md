# Shells and Terminals
[Official Shell Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands)

Using shell to manage the operating system is an essential task and therefore, we start with the [terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) and [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)). In the history of Windows and DOS, there were many shell or built-in script interpreters, and also numerous terminal applications. Here, we only cover the shells and terminals relevant to the most recent versions of Windows.

There are two **shells** in Windows:

- [command prompt (Command shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) (`cmd.exe`)
    - very simple and limited functionality
    - successor of [`COMMAND.COM`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMMAND.COM)
    - For Command shell solutions/guides, check the [Command shell manual](./Comand%20shell.md).
- [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
    - Modern shell with many features
    - Supports all the Windows commands (commands from the Command shell)
    - For PowerShell solutions/guides, check the [PoweShell manual](./Powershell%20Manual.md).


There are two **terminal applications** in Windows: 

- [Windows Console Host (`conhost.exe`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Console): an old terminal application present in Windows for years
    - startup program is the command prompt
    - default terminal application in Windows 10 and older
    - no longer relevant in Windows 11
- [Windows Terminal (`wt.exe`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal): a new terminal application that is still in development.
    - startup program can be configured (PowerShell by default)
    - default terminal application in Windows 11, available in the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal) in older versions of Windows
    - modern terminal, almost Linux-like experience


## Run a non-default terminal application
It is not an easy task to manually run a shell in a non-default terminal application. To do it, we need to execute the terminal application executable:

- Windows Terminal: `wt.exe`
- Windows Console Host: `conhost.exe`


## Windows Terminal
The Windows Terminal is a new terminal application with many great features:

- multiple tabs
- smart text selection

To configure Windows Terminal, click the `v` button in the top bar and select `Settings`. There are two kinds of settings:

- Global settings sorted in categories in the left panel
- Profile settings for each profile. The profiles are listed in the left panel. After selecting a profile, the settings are displayed in the right panel. Nonbasic settings are sorted in categories under the `Additonal settings` header. 


### Windows terminal pass stdout to text editor instead displaying it
This can happen if the output is too long or wide for the terminal. 

If a command outputs a text in Windows console host but passes it to a text editor in Windows Terminal, the possible cause is the font size. The default size in Windows Terminal is 12, which is much larger than the 16 in Windows Console Host (default). To fix it, change the font size in Windows Terminal to 10 which corresponds to the 16 in Windows Console Host.


## Command Prompt
Compared to PowerShell or Linux shells, the Command Prompt is very limited. Therefore, we describe only the most important commands. For more advanced commands, use PowerShell.

To **change the current directory**, use the `cd` command. However, in the Command Prompt, this command cannot be used to change the drive. To change the drive, use the drive letter followed by a colon, e.g., command `D:` changes the drive to `D:`.


## Character Encoding
By default, Windows use the local ANSI code page for the character encoding, both in Command Prompt and PowerShell. We can change this encoding in an active console window, for example, command `chcp 65001` changes the encoding to UTF-8 in Command Prompt. To do a permanent change, we have to edit Windows settings:

1. Open the Windows settings
2. Go to `Time & language` -> `Language & region` -> `Administrative language settings`
3. Click on the `Change system locale...` button
4. Check the `Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support` checkbox


# Execution of Programs, Scripts, Commands and similar
The execution of programs, scripts, commands and other [executable files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) is a common, yet mysterious task in almost every operating system. To prevent confusion, it is absolutely essential to know what, and under what conditions is executed. The most important lesson is that the two Windows shells, Command Prompt and PowerShell, has a different approach to execution, and also, the executables can be run outside a shell with, yet different, mechanisms.

The table below ([source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VFe5h2yHPPUxluh3l-Vm2sCkEIDKXt-RJ3YuprnJgNM/edit?usp=sharing)) presents the basics of the Windows **execution logic when we execute the program by its name**:

Notes:

1. The system (`CreateProcessW` function) only considers native executables (`.exe` files).
1. PowerShell never search local directory when executing program by name, due to security reasons.
    - This can be changed by adding `.` (current directory) to the `PATH` environment variable (not recommended).
1. PowerShell scripts are not considered as executables by Command Shell, again, due to security reasons.
    - This can be changed by modifying the `PATHEXT` environment variable that lists the executable file extensions considered by `cmd.exe` and system (not recommended).

The table above cover only what can and what cannot be executed by the name. However, when duplicate names are present, the **resolution order** becomes important. Also, there may be various ways how to execute the same executable in the same shell. For details, check the respective sections of the manual for each execution environment:

- [System (Out of the shell) execution](./Windows%20Manual.md#system-out-of-the-shell-execution)
- [Command shell execution](./Comand%20shell.md#executable-execution)
- [PowerShell shell execution](./Powershell%20Manual.md#executable-execution)

If we **execute using the path**, the execution is consistent among all three execution environments (cmd, pwsh and system).

After the executable is found by the name or path, it is executed in an environment determinded by its file type association, which is by default:

- program: execute the program itself (there is some bootstrapping logic, but it is not important for us)
- batch script: `cmd.exe`
- PowerShell script: `notepad.exe`. It is very useful to reconfiure this association to PowerShell.


## System (Out of the shell) execution
The system execution is realized by calling the [`CreateProcessW`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw) function.

The executable path resolution is as follows:

If the executable is a path, the path is evaluated. Otherwise, the name is searched in the locations below (in order):

1. The directory of the calling process
1. Current working directory of the calling process
1. System directories 
    1. 32-bit system directory
    1. 16-bit system directory
    1. Windows directory
1. Directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable, in the order they are listed

Unlike Command Shell and PowerShell, the system execution does not consider script files, only native executables. Only the `.exe` extension is considered if the file name is specified without the extension.

2. If it does not help, proceeed to the next section (even if the pairing is successfull)

### Cannot pair with the device
Turn off the device and unplug it from the electricity/remove batteries. Then plug it back after ~10 seconds, power it of, and try to pair with it again.

## Bluetooth Command Line Tools
https://bluetoothinstaller.com/bluetooth-command-line-tools

Bluetooth Command Line Tools is a set off tools that enables command line interaction with blootooth services. Basic usage:

- discover and list available devices: `btdiscovery -s`

# Filesytem

## Standard folder structure
In Windows, the standard folder structure is completely different for system and user instalation. Details are listed below, but the main difference is that the system instalations are stored in a single root folder for each application (similarly to Android), while the user instalations' files are distributed among multiple folders, depending on the type of the file (similarly to Linux).

The standard folders can be quick-accessed by aliases written in the form `%alias%`. These aliases works in Windows Explorer and Command Prompt. To use them in PowerShell, we have to access them as environment variables, e.g. `$env:alias`.

### User home folder
The user home folder is located in `C:\Users\<username>` by default. It is aliased as `%userprofile%`. 


### System instalation folders
If an application is installed for all users, all its files are usually installed in a single folder per application. The location of the folder depends on the type of the application:

- `C:\Program Files`: 64-bit applications
- `C:\Program Files (x86)`: 32-bit applications

If the application needs to store some data, they are usually stored in the `C:\ProgramData` (aliased as `%programdata%`) folder.


### User instalation folders
User instalations are stored in multiple folders, depending on the type of the file. All these folders are located in the user's home folder, which is `C:\Users\<username>` by default. The folders are:

- `~\AppData\Local`: Program data and sometimes also executables
- `~\AppData\Local\Promgrams`: program files and executables
- `~\AppData\LocalLow`:
- `~\AppData\Roaming` (aliased as `%appdata%`):

### Start Menu folder
The user specific shortcuts are stored in: `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`.

The system wide shortcuts are stored in: `%programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`.


## Read Only Files and Folders
An ancient form of file protection on Windows is the read only flag that can be set on files and folders. It is not a real protection, as it can be easily removed by the user, but it can be used to prevent accidental changes.

Most of the programs can ignore this flag and work with the file anyway. However, some programs (e.g. Python) can have problems with it.


## Formatting a drive/partition or disk
When we want to delete all data from a drive/partition or disk and start over, we use the procedure called formatting. There are various tools for that, with different trade-offs between capabilities and complexity.

In all tools, there are two variants of formatting:

- Quick Format: All files are forgotten, but they data is not overwritten. Best choice most of the time but:
	- other people can still recover the data using special software, and
	- when bootable disk is formatted this way, the BIOS can still boot from it, confusing the user.
- Full Format: All files are forgotten and the data is overwritten with zeros. This is the safe option, but it can take a long time.

There are several tools for formatting:

- `properties` window of the drive in File Explorer:
	- can only format mounted drives
- `Disk Management` tool in `Computer Management`
- `diskpart` command line tool




# Sugarsync
Quick orientation in the desktop app:

- for file changes, check left menu -> `Activity`
- for deleted files, check left menu -> `Deleted Items`

## Solving sync problems

1. check if the file is updated in cloud using web browser
2. if not, check the activity log on the computer with the updated file
3. if the change is not in the log, a simple hack can help: copy the file outside SugarSync folder and back.



# Useful Commands

## Get Motherboard Info
```PowerShell
wmic baseboard get product,Manufacturer,version,serialnumber
```

## Copy multiple files/dirs
[`robocopy`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) is the best command for that. Usefull params:

- `/e`: Copy subdirectories, including empty ones
- `/b`: Copy in the backup mode, so that even files with a different owner can be copied
- `/xc`: Excludes changed files.
- `/xn`: Excludes newer files.
- `/xo`: Excludes older files.
- `/r:<n>`: Specifies the number of retries on failed copies. The default value of _n_ is 1,000,000 (one million retries).
- `/w:<n>`: Specifies the wait time between retries, in seconds. The default value of _n_ is 30 (wait time 30 seconds).


## `echoargs`: Print arguments as passed to the script
Sometimes, it is hard to see what are the exact arguments passed to an executable. To debug it quickly, we can use the `echoargs.exe` tool present in Portable Programs or at [ss64]( https://ss64.com/ps/EchoArgs.exe). Usage:

```PowerShell
echoargs <command> <arguments>
```


## User info
Information about users can be obtained with the [`Get-LocalUser`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.localaccounts/get-localuser?view=powershell-7.1) command. By default, the command lists all users. Some useful params:

- `-Name`: Specifies the user account names of the users to get. 
- `-SID`: Specifies the security identifier (SID) of the users to get. 


# Installation
Windows can be installed from bootable USB created by a [tool downloaded from the official Miccosoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/cs-cz/software-download/). There is a single image for all Windows editions, a particular version is choosen based on the license key.

The license can be purchased online either from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/cs-cz/d/windows-11-home/dg7gmgf0krt0) (be sure to buy it on CZ website, it cannot be bought on the US website) or from a retailer (e.g., [Alza](https://www.alza.cz/microsoft-windows-11/18891706.htm)). Licenses are transferable, not OEM, unless specified otherwise. The Home version is typically sufficient.

Installation Steps:

1. Get a license key
1. Download the install tool from Microsoft
1. Run the tool and create a bootable USB
1. Start the installation
1. Fill in the licence key
1. Choose where to install Windows
1. Complete the installation guide


## Post Installation Steps

- Import the disks from previous installations.

### Import disks
After installation, only the main disk and newly installed disk are initialized. Other disks will be marked as foreign in the disk management tool, and the drives on them will not show up in File Explorer.

To import the disks:

1. Go to `Computer Management` -> `Storage` -> `Disk Management`
2. Right click on disk marked as foreign and select `Import foreign disks`

## Installation Problems

### We couldn’t create a partition or locate an existing one
Ensure that the boot priority of the drive where the Windows should be installed is right behind the installation USB priority.

### windows installation encountered an unexpected error 0x80042444 - 0x4002F
This error is triggered by SATA drives from a different OS installation. There are two solutions:

- Use the legacy Windows installer that can be started from a small link on one of the initial installation screens.
- disconnect the SATA drives from previous installations, either physically, or in BIOS/UEFI



# Configuration

## Changing the input method
It is possible to let the system have a different input method for each app. It is not possible however, to remember the input method (after app/OS restart).

### Troubleshooting

#### Nothing happens after clicking on the input method in the taskbar (windows 10)
restrat the computer :)

## Right Click Menu

### Bring the old right click menu back to Windows 11
There is a new right click menu in Windows 11, which is much less practical than the old one. To bring the old one back, we have to edit the registry:

```PowerShell
reg.exe add "HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\InprocServer32" /f /ve
```

### Configure the items in the right click menu
Unfortunatelly, the right click menu is not directly configurable in Windows. Usually, the actions are enabled by the application installation (sometimes, this can be disabled in the installation process), and can only be removed by editing the registry or uninstalling the application. Below, we list instructions for each specific action.

#### Share with Skype

1. in an elevated PowerShell, run:
	```PowerShell
	REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Blocked" /v "{776DBC8D-7347-478C-8D71-791E12EF49D8}" /d Skype
	```

2. restart the Explorer

#### PowerToys modules
These can be removed by deactivating the specific modules in the PowerToys settings.

#### Edit with Notepad
Just Uninstall the Notepad. Yes, it can be done.

#### Scan with Microsoft Defender
The following commands removes four entries from the registry that are related to this icon:
```PowerShell
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\EPP"
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{09A47860-11B0-4DA5-AFA5-26D86198A780}"
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\EPP"
REG DELETE "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\EPP"
```

[Source](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101364-remove-scan-microsoft-defender-context-menu-windows-10-a.html)

#### Translate with Deepl
Haven't found a way to remove it yet. Even uninstalling the Deepl does not help.




# Diskpart
[documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskpart)

Diskpart is a useful command line tool for work with disks, partitions, etc. We start it by running `diskpart` command, and then, we use other commands to manage the disks. 

Basic general commands:

- `list disk`: list all disks
- `exit`: exit diskpart
- `select disk <disk number>`: select the disk to manage

When a disk is selected, we can use other commands:

- `list partition`: list all partitions on the selected disk
- `list volume`: list all volumes on the selected disk. A volume is a mount point for a partition.
- `select partition <partition number>`: select the partition to manage






## Find out wheteher a disk is MBR or GPT

# Open Command Promp from the Windows 10 USB

1. Insert the USB stick
2. Wait till the first installation screen
3. `shift` + `F10`

# Firewall
## Generate firewall logs

1. Go to Windows firewall and select properties on the right
2. At the top, choose the profile corresponding to the current network profile
3. In the logging section, click to customizze
4. set both DROP and ACCEPT to yes

Do not forgot to turn of the logging after the investigation!



# SSH
For ssh, we can use the standard `ssh` commannd available in Windows (check Linux manual for more info). If the command is not available, it can be installed in `Apps & Features` -> `Optional features`.

One thing that differs from Linux is that the Windows ssh does not support the `<addres>:<port>` syntax. To specify the port, it is necessary to use the `-p` parameter

For more features, we can use other programs

- [KiTTY](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/index.html#!pages/Portability.md) for credentials storage, automatic reconection, etc.
- [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) for file manipulation


## KiTTY
It is best to use the portable version, so that nothing is stored in the Windows registry. Configurtation:

- [copy the PuTTY credentials](): `.\kitty_portable-0.76.1.3.exe -convert-dir`
- auto reconnect: `Connection` -> `auto reconnect on connection failure` and `auto reconnect on system wakeup`


## WinSCP
WinSCP is a graphical tool for file manipulation. Ii can be used both for local and remote files, and it supports various protocols (FTP, SFTP, SCP, WebDAV, etc.). 

### Adding a new connection
There is a simple `New Site` button on the left, which opens a straightforward dialog. The only complicated thing can be the SSH key. To add it, click on the `Advanced` button and go to the `SSH` -> `Authentication` tab. There, we can select the private key file.


### Bookmarks
To add bookmarks, go to `Local`/`Remote` -> `Add Path to Bookmarks` or press `Ctrl` + `B`.

To open a bookmark, go to `Local`/`Remote` -> `Go To` -> `Open Drirectory/bookmark` or press `Ctrl` + `O`.



## SSH key agent
To enable the ssh-agent on Windows, one extra step is needed: we need to start the ssh-agent service. To do that, open the services manager and start the `OpenSSH Authentication Agent` service.


# Git
Most of the git functionality is the same as in Linux, so check the Linux manual for more info. However, there are some important differences mostly resulting from the fact that Git is not a native Windows application, but it runs in MinGW. 

## Git on Windows and SSH
As the git on Windows runs in MinGW, it does not use the Windows SSH command. That can be problematic if we want to debug the SSH connection using the env variable or configuring an ssh key agent. To force git to use the Windows SSH, we need to set the `sshCommand` config variable to the path to the Windows SSH:
```PowerShell
git config --global core.sshCommand C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe
```

# VPN
VPN is natively supported in Windows. It can be set up in two ways:

- using a system dialog
- in PowerShell

If the system dialog does not work, try the PowerShell method.




# WSL

## Translate Windows Path to Linux Path
To translate a Windows path to a Linux path, we can use the `wslpath` command, which is available in Ubuntu WSL distributions.

## Execute commands from the Windows
We can directly execute commands in the WSL from the Windows command line without logging into the WSL with the [`wsl`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands) command. The syntax is:
```PowerShell
wsl <command>
```

Important arguments:

- `-u <user>, --user <user>`: run the command as the specified user. This can be useful for running the command as the root user.


# Dual Boot

## Make Windows Work after Linux Uninstall if the Bootloader is Grub

1. Get rid of the Grub bootloader
2. Set the Windows bootloader as the primary partition
	- it is the small partition at the beginning of the main disk



# Shims
[Shims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)) are small programs that are used to replace the original program, typically to run it with some additional parameters. On Windows, the shims can be easilly integrated into the system by adding the folder with the shims to the beginning of the `PATH` environment variable.

As a shim, we can use:

- any executable file (`*.exe`)
- a [batch file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) (`*.bat`, `*.cmd`)
- a PowerShell script (`*.ps1`)
    - note that the PowerShell script shims works only for PowerShell. To make it work outside PowerShell, we need to accommpany it with a batch file that runs the PowerShell script:
    ```batch
    @echo off
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%~dp0\script.ps1" %*
    ```



# Problems

## Folder Sharing Problems
Note that updated **Windows 10 disabled anonymous sharing**, so password protected sharing has to be turned on. 

**To login, use the credentials for the computer with the shared folder**. 

Below is a list of possible problems, together with solutions.

### The user name or password is incorrect

1. Check whether the computer can be seen in the network. If not, resolve this issue first.
	- quick check by running `net view <IP address>`
2. Check that you are using the right username. You need to **use the username and password of the computer you are connecting to**.
	- Check that the user name is correct by running `net user` on the target computer
	- Check that the folder is shared with you in: right click on the folder -> `Properties` -> `Sharing` -> `Advanced Sharing...` -> `Permisions`. Note that your full name can be there instead of your username, which is OK.
4. Check that you are using the right password. You have to use the password associated with your microsoft account. Note that **it can differ from the password (PIN) you are using to log in to the computer!**
3. check it on the command line: `net use * \\<IP address>\<drive letter>$ /use:<username> <password>`

### Folder right and ownership cannot be read
Try to clear the windows filecache (CCcleaner or restart)

### Computer does not see itself in Network section in File Explorer
Solution to this problem is to restart the service called *Function Discovery Resource Publication*. Either restart it in Computer Management -> Services, or by:
```
net stop FDResPub
net start FDResPub
```


## PC wakes up or cannot enter sleep

### 1 Find the source
Using the Event viwer

1. open the event viewer
