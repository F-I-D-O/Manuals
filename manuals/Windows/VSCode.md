# Settings
## Language specific settings
Almost all settings can be set specifically to some language.  To do that:

1. in settings, next to the filter box, click on the filter icon and select language
2. select the language
3. find the setting either manually or by adding more filters
4. change the setting

To be sure that the setting is applied only to the selected language, look at the panel under the search box. Instead of `User`, `Workspace`, there should be `User[<language>]`, `Workspace[<language>]`.
