# Characters with special meaning in YAML
[documentation](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#53-indicator-characters)

The following characters have special meaning in YAML: ``{, }, [, ], &, *, #, ?, |, -, <, >, =, !, %, @, :, ` `` and `,`. In strings, these characters should be quoted. They have to be avoided in keys.
